# **Projects:**

- *Guide to Review and Study of Probabilistic and Inferential Statistics with Python*

### In this project, I conduct a study on the key points of statistics and inference using Python. Completely self-created, the study begins with probability basics and progresses through fundamental calculations, covering Bernoulli, Binomial, and Poisson probabilities for discrete variables, as well as Normal, Weibull, Exponential, and others for continuous variables.

### Additionally, in the inference section, I demonstrate how to use libraries like Scipy and Statsmodels to infer means, medians, proportions, and confidence intervals from data, as well as statistical tests and their errors.

### The project concludes with a comprehensive study of regressions, from linear to robust regressions, including their applications and evaluations.

### This study is complete and I believe it will be highly valuable for those learning more about statistics in Python.

- *Study Guide and Review of Machine Learning in Supervised Practical Activities*

### In this guide, I cover how to handle data for supervised learning algorithms, including inputting missing values, label encoding, scaling, and transformations. I also discuss topics such as optimization with GridSearch and the evaluation of regression and classification models. Finally, I delve into the models themselves, exploring their uses, methods, and functional logic.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on Machine Learning and Data Analytics projects.

- I bring my experience with Statistics and Machine Learning through mini-projects that aim to explore the complexity and variety of data in the world.

- ðŸ¤“ Among my key skills, I highlight Excel, Python, R, Power BI (storytelling and related), and SQL.

- âœ… I always strive to provide new and powerful insights, operating through the lens of business and root cause analysis.

- Having worked in the data field for 3 years with various projects, I am starting my repository here. The idea of this repository is to showcase my skills.

- ðŸ“˜ Probability, Estimation, Hypothesis Testing, Regression, and Forecasting with Machine Learning will be some of the topics you'll find here today!
